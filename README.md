# 🫀 End-to-End Heart Disease Risk Analysis and Interactive Visualization Using Excel, SQL, and Tableau

This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset to identify key risk factors associated with cardiovascular conditions. Using Excel, SQL, and Tableau, I cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and visualized the data to answer critical healthcare questions and provide data-driven insights that support early detection and prevention strategies.

This project is perfect for:

- 📊 Data Analyst aspirants who want to build a strong Portfolio Project for interviews and LinkedIn
- 📚 Anyone learning Python, SQL, and Power BI
- 💼 Professionals preparing for interviews in Data Analytics, Data Science or Product Analytics roles
